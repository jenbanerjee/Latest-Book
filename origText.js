var $page1 =	"MCFirstName stood outside the gates of SchoolName, waiting for MCParents to finish chatting. MCSheHeCapital was chewing MCHerHisLower lip, humming a tune, puffing out MCHerHisLower cheeks, examining the floor and kicking at bits of leaves and twigs that MCSheHeLower found there. In short, MCSheHeLower was trying very hard not to cry. When a single tear made its way down MCHerHisLower cheek, MCSheHeLower swiped it away with MCHerHisLower hand and looked around for some other distraction. That's when MCSheHeLower first laid eyes on Mrs Montague.";

var $page2 =	"Mrs Montague (of course MCFirstName didn't actually know her name yet) had dropped her shopping trolley not far from where MCFirstName was standing. All of her shopping had spilled out onto the pavement and she was struggling to pick it all up again. Every now and then she would reach down to the ground, just miss whatever she was grasping for and then she'd straighten up, look at the sky and shake her head. MCFirstName was sure MCSheHeLower could hear her humming.<p>\
MCSheHeCapital wandered over, grabbing at a few stray apples along the way.<p>\
\"Here you go\", MCSheHeLower said, lifting the shopping trolley back up to standing and popping the apples back inside. Mrs Montague watched MCFirstName as MCSheHeLower scrambled around the pavement collecting carrots and potatoes, bread rolls and sausages and stuffing them back into the trolley. When MCFirstName had retrieved the very last onion MCSheHeLower looked up at Mrs Montague and saw her properly for the first time.";

var $page3 =	"Mrs Montague was not very tall for a grown up. Her hair was a mass of tight white curls and she wore a bright red hat on top. But what really struck MCFirstName was the expression on her face. Mrs Montague was beaming: her mouth stretched almost from one ear to the other, her skin was squeezed into lovely soft wrinkles, especially around her bright green eyes, which shone and twinkled at MCFirstName.<p>\
\"Do you know?\" she said, \"I was feeling ever so down just now and your kindness has lifted me up and made me feel like dancing. And that doesn't happen all that often these days, I can tell you. Thank you very much indeed.\"<p>\
MCFirstName was reminded of how sad MCSheHeLower was feeling and a little bit embarrassed, because hadn't MCSheHeLower really been trying to cheer MCHimselfHerself up? MCSheHeCapital wasn't sure MCSheHeLower deserved the praise and that made MCHerHimLower feel even worse.<p>\
\"Oh, that's OK\" MCSheHeLower muttered, looking down at the ground again as a fat tear sploshed onto the pavement.";

var $page4 =	"\"Hmmm, if I'm not mistaken, you're not looking all that happy yourself.\" said Mrs Montague. And then she introduced herself. \"I'm Mrs Montague. I'm 89 and live just round the corner from here. I'd be delighted if you would like to tell me who you are and why you are looking so terribly sad.\"<p>\
MCFirstName took a deep breath. \"I'm MCFirstName MCSurname. I'm MCAge. And I live on MCAddress. I'm sad because my school is going to have to shut down. We've just been to a big meeting and SchoolHeadName, our SchoolHeadMasterMistress, says there was a fire, and there isn't enough money to repair the damage. I love SchoolName, and my friends, and now we will all have to go to different schools instead.\"<p>\
Mrs Montague looked long and hard at MCFirstName then she nodded her head and seemed to come to a decision. \"Well, MCFirstName MCSurname\" she said, \"that is a sad story and I am very sorry to hear it. But I am very pleased to have met you. Keep your chin up, my dear. You never know what good things might happen.\"<p>\
Just then, MCParents called out to MCFirstName, so MCSheHeLower waved goodbye to Mrs Montague and ran back to join MCParentsHerHimThem.";

var $page5 =	"The following Saturday, MCFirstName was having breakfast when MCSheHeLower heard the postman arrive. Normally MCSheHeLower would not have found this remotely interesting. Normally the post was very boring, full of dull looking white or brown envelopes for MCParents. But there was something in the air this morning. A whiff of the unusual somehow, that made MCFirstName think that today just might not be normal. So MCSheHeLower went to see what had come. And there, on top of the usual white and brown envelopes was a bright green one, with silver writing on it. MCSheHeCapital picked it up and read it.<p>\
MCFirstName MCSurname<br>\
MCAddress<br>\
TOP SECRET<p>\
Everyone else was busy getting showered and dressed. MCParents had promised MCFirstName that they could do whatever MCFirstName chose to do that weekend, in an effort to cheer MCHerHimLower up after the news about MCHerHisLower school. MCSheHeCapital was still trying to make up MCHerHisLower mind, but, forgetting all about that, MCSheHeLower ran to MCHerHisLower room and ripped open the envelope.";

var $page6 = "Dear Friend, I'd like to help you, here is what I have in mind:<br>\
Since you've already shown me you are both polite and kind,<br>\
So prove they teach you well in class, that you are not a fool<br>\
If you can solve my riddles then perhaps you'll save your school.<br>\
Now choose NumberFriendsToInvite to help you to  pull off this tricky stunt<br>\
Please find below the first clue in this SECRET Treasure Hunt!<br>\
<p>\
MCFirstName felt as if MCHerHisLower heart was doing a Rumba. Or was it the Tango? Or possibly the Caterpillar. Either way, it was definitely going bananas and MCSheHeLower suddenly felt like dancing. MCSheHeCapital threw the letter up in the air, leapt onto MCHerHisLower bed and performed the well-known \"Jig of Joy\", whooping and punching the air. There was hope after all! And then just as suddenly MCSheHeLower came back to Earth with a bump (or, quite literally, MCHerHisLower bed with a thump) and felt the full weight of responsibility land on MCHerHisLower shoulders. The whole of SchoolName was now depending on MCHerHimLower. What if MCSheHeLower couldn't do it?";

var $page7 =	"\"Pull yourself together, MCFirstName\" MCSheHeLower told MCHimselfHerself sternly. \"You're not on your own. It says you can choose NumberFriendsToInvite.\" This helped to calm MCHerHimLower down and MCSheHeLower started to think carefully about who MCSheHeLower could share this special mission with. In the end, it was easy:<p>\
MCSheHeCapital would have to ask MCHerHisLower OC1Descriptor, OC1Name as MCSheHeLower couldn't possibly keep such a secret from OC1HerHimLower and the letter did say it had to be secret.<p>\
Then there was MCHerHisLower OC2Descriptor, OC2Name. MCFirstName always felt calmer with OC2Name around and MCSheHeLower always thought more clearly when MCSheHeLower was calm.<p>\
MCHerHisCapital OC3Descriptor, OC3Name, was very wise. MCFirstName often confided in OC3Name and OC3Name usually gave good advice.<p>\
And finally there was MCHerHisLower OC4Descriptor, OC4Name. Clever and loyal - MCSheHeLower couldn't do it without OC4Name either.<p>\
So that makes NumFriends, MCSheHeLower counted. Perfect.";

var $page8 =	"InvitingFriendsMCFirstName gathered the team in MCHerHisLower room. MCSheHeCapital told them that MCSheHeLower really needed their help and asked them if they could keep a secret. When they all agreed, MCSheHeLower showed them the letter. Then MCSheHeLower took a deep breath and said \"Well? What do you think? Will you help me?\". They all looked at MCFirstName, eyes shining with anticipation.<p>\

MCFirstName let out MCHerHisLower breath with a nervous laugh, smiled at MCHerHisLower friends and said \"Thanks, Guys. Right, let's do this! We'd better have a look at the first clue...\"";

var $page9 =	"This place is full of great stories to borrow<br>\
To fill you with laughter, and sometimes with sorrow<br>\
Learning is easy here, be in no doubt<br>\
Shhhh, you'll have to be quiet, or you'll get sent out!<br>\
<p>\
MCFirstName read the clue out loud. MCHerHisCapital heart sank. The answer to this was obviously school. That's where MCSheHeLower did most of MCHerHisLower laughing and that's where you go to learn. And everyone knows you can get sent out of the classroom for being too noisy. But how could they get into school during the holidays? And with all the fire damage as well, it could be very dangerous if they tried... <p>\ MCSheHeCapital looked around the group and could see most of the others were thinking the same thing.<p>\
SolveClue1";

var $page10 =	"\"You little beauty!\" MCSheHeLower yelped, CelebrateClue1 OC2Name. \"Of course! The library! That's where you go to borrow stories! Come on, everyone\". MCSheHeCapital raced off to find MCParents, with the rest of the crew close behind.<p>\
\"MCParents! Please can we go to LibraryName now?\" MCSheHeLower blurted.<p>\
MCParents looked, for a moment, a bit like MCParentsSingulargoldfish. Big, startled eyes, MCParentsMouth hanging open, completely unable to speak.<p>\
Then MCParentsSheHeThey found MCParentsHerHisTheir voice. \"Let's get this straight. MCParentsWeI've said we can do whatever you like today and you've decided you'd like to go to LibraryName? What's going on?\".<p>\
MCFirstName quickly realised that, to keep this Treasure Hunt a secret, MCSheHeLower would have to be a little bit more careful. \"Oh, well it doesn't matter really, I suppose,\" MCSheHeLower said casually \"but my library book is overdue. I thought we could just pop in while we decide what else to do with the day?\".<p>\
MCParentsSheHeTheyCapital couldn't argue with that. \"Are we all going?\" MCParentsSheHeThey asked, looking doubtfully at OC1Name, OC2Name, OC3Name and OC4Name. Everyone nodded and off they went.";

var $page11 =	"LibraryName was much like any other library that Saturday morning: peaceful, quiet and full of books. While MCFirstName took MCHerHisLower book to the counter, the rest of the team spread out to look for the next clue. MCFirstName tried to drag the process out for as long as possible, finding all sorts of things to talk to the librarian about. Unfortunately this librarian was neither chatty, nor interesting, which made the whole thing a bit difficult.<p>\
<p>\
FindClue2<p>\
<p>\
\"Woohoo!\" MCSheHeLower cried.<p>\
\"So you like rain then?\" said the librarian, finally looking interested. But MCFirstName had rushed off with OC3Name to find MCHerHisLower other friends. They had to be quick before MCParents got too impatient. MCSheHeCapital ripped open the envelope, pulled out the piece of paper and read out the next clue.";

var $page12 =	"I go backwards and forwards, I hang from a bar<br>\

\"Er, no thanks.\" said MCFirstName. \"At least, not just yet\" MCSheHeLower added, just in case they might need to later. \"Actually, we'd like to go to PlaygroundName, please. We want to go on the swings.\"<p>\
So off they went to PlaygroundName. When they arrived they headed straight for the swings and began combing the area for brightly coloured envelopes. They looked on the ground, all around, and up on the bar, but there was no sign of any envelope. They sat down on the ground to figure out what to do next.<p>\
MCParents started to catch up with them and called over \"Hey, is everything alright? MCParentsWeI thought you wanted to go on the swings, not just look at them\".<p>\
MCFirstName jumped on a seat and started swinging it backwards and forwards, hoping to buy some time and find some inspiration. Perhaps they should try a different park? But how many swings could they ask to go to before MCParents got very suspicious?";

var $page16 =	"MCParents wandered over. \"Anyone getting hungry for some lunch?\".<p>\
MCFirstName was too excited about the Treasure Hunt to be hungry, but grabbed the opportunity with both hands. \"Yes, please! Can we go to ShopName and get a sandwich?\"<p>\
\"Is that what you really fancy?\" MCParentsSheHeThey asked looking at MCFirstName with the expression MCParentsSheHeThey usually used when MCSheHeLower was coming down with something. A sandwich from ShopName wasn't normally MCFirstName's first choice.<p>\
\"Yes, please. It's exactly what I want.\" said MCFirstName. The others nodded enthusiastically.<p>\
\"OK then...\" MCParentsSheHeThey said, pleased and puzzled at the same time. MCFirstName was certainly looking happier than MCSheHeLower had in a while... better to just go with it MCParentsSheHeThey thought. \"ShopName it is\".";

var $page17 =	"The team spread out to search across the shop. MCParents kept calling people back to the sandwich section to choose what they wanted. Once everyone had selected something, MCParents got in the queue to pay. The team came back together, all holding their empty hands up in despair. They hadn't found a clue anywhere.<p>\
Then MCFirstName realised somebody was missing. Where was OC2Name? In a panic, MCSheHeLower headed off again round the shop, this time desperately searching for MCHerHisLower OC2Descriptor.<p>\

MCParents sighed, shrugged and led the way.";

var $page21 =	"Back at home, they gathered in MCFirstName's room for one final attempt to solve the last clue. They were shouting out colours and animals, names of trees, kings and queens, and all kinds of vehicles, hoping that something would give them the answer. It was getting close to dinner - they were running out of time.<p>\
MCFirstName left the room to get drinks, but stopped when MCSheHeLower heard MCParents talking. \"What a clever riddle\" MCParentsSheHeThey MCParentsWereWas saying. \"I wonder where MCSheHeLower got it from?\" MCFirstName froze - it must have fallen out of MCHerHisLower pocket. \"Funny thing for a child to have a riddle about pubs though.\"<p>\
MCFirstName forgot all about the drinks. MCSheHeCapital ran back into MCHerHisLower room and shut the door. \"I've got it\" MCSheHeLower said. \"It's a pub! Loads of pubs are named after animals, like The Red Lion. That's got to be it. We could go to the pub for dinner. We can still do this, we can still save the school!\".<p>\
And then MCFirstName and OC1Name and OC2Name and OC3Name and OC4Name all did the \"Jig of Joy\" before MCFirstName shouted loudly \"MCParents! Can we go to PubName for dinner?\".";

var $page22	= "They walked into PubName and there she was - Mrs Montague. Of course you'll have guessed that she was behind the Treasure Hunt, but MCFirstName hadn't. Not until MCSheHeLower saw her at least. Then MCSheHeLower had an inkling. And when she came over to MCFirstName with her beaming smile and her arms open wide, MCFirstName knew for sure.<p>\
Mrs Montague introduced herself to MCParents and MCFirstName introduced Mrs Montague to OC1Name, OC2Name, OC3Name and OC4Name. Then Mrs Montague explained what was going on.<p>\
\"I happen to have quite a lot of money you see. And I don't have any children or grandchildren of my own to look after. MCFirstName was extremely kind to me at a time when I was feeling rather sad and it gave me hope again. I wanted to do something for MCHerHimLower in return, but I do love a good game and thought we could have a little fun along the way. I knew MCSheHeLower and MCHerHisLower friends would be clever enough to solve my clues and keep the secret. I'm so glad you proved me right. I shall speak to the school on Monday and let them know I will pay for the repairs. They should be very proud to have such a wonderful pupil.\"<p>\

MCSheHeCapital tried to smile and pretend it was just excitement. But MCSheHeLower knew deep down that MCSheHeLower was feeling very, very guilty. Mrs Montague thought that MCFirstName and MCHerHisLower friends were clever enough to solve the clues. MCHerHisCapital friends had been clever, but MCSheHeLower hadn't solved any of the clues MCHimselfHerself. And in the end MCSheHeLower hadn't really kept it a secret as MCParents had seen the last clue. Worst of all, MCParentsSheHeThey had solved it and MCSheHeLower had pretended to everyone that it was MCHerHimLower.<p>\
If MCSheHeLower told the truth, the school wouldn't get the money it needed and would close. If MCSheHeLower didn't tell the truth, MCSheHeLower might feel this horrible forever. MCSheHeCapital took a deep breath and stood up.<p>\

And to OC1Name, OC2Name, OC3Name and OC4Name for being brilliant, clever and loyal friends. The thing is, I cheated. MCParents got the answer to the last clue and I pretended it was me. I wanted so much to save SchoolName. I'm so sorry everyone that I've let you all down.\" MCSheHeCapital couldn't bear to look at the disappointment in their faces. \"Can we go home now, please?\" MCSheHeLower mumbled to the floor as MCSheHeLower headed for the door.";
